The word Piss (recruiting) has been used either alone or in a sentence since the late 1990s (Ex: piss-off). The word shit was used in some events.

For this reason, we do not censor this because Iran or Malaysia on a state basis accuse satanism as perverted. Or we do not censor FARC images because they oppose the Colombian state on a political basis. Or, on a religious basis, we do not critically approach Islamic articles in other languages ​​with non-Islamic values ​​in that local culture and censor Islamic defenses. The same thing should be the same here, for example, because I am dominating3, we cannot censor anti-religious images in the Soviet Union on the grounds of the opposite of Islamic sensitivities in articles on this topic, because they exist.

I am aware that he has escaped a little bit of news, but a new state title in the Balkans is VP: TBA violation. The recognition of this country is a painful process, many countries, especially Serbia, have declared that they will not recognize it, so a state-style phrase that will emphasize the recognition of this country will make Wikipedia a party in this recognition debate. However, in accordance with the impartiality policy of Wikipedia, it is neutral if countries are recognized and not recognized by other countries; It shows neither the recognition nor the recognition of them, as a 3rd party it indicates who does not know who knows.

We do not even know which parties will be elected yet, so it is too early to add such tables. I hope you have no objection. Actually, I realized that in some provinces you have opened articles on the November 2015 elections. It is not correct to open a new selection item by copying information about the previous election. It is erroneous to assume that the number of voters is the same as the previous election, for example, those who have died since the last election, 18 who have been moved, etc. there is. Voter lists will be suspended again, numbers will be determined again. Also, as I said, it is not clear which parties will participate in the elections, for example it is possible that a party that entered the previous elections did not participate in these elections. So it is too early to open such pages, we do not have the information to fill it up yet.

The statements, in a journalistic interview, of two of the wounded in the plaza, support this idea. 3- In short, the Paraguayan March was a titanic assembly elaborated to overthrow the government of Cubas Grau and Lino Oviedo.

It may even be more beautiful in terms of the internal consistency of Turkish. However, the truth is, we used to use Dutch and Dutch words. And the only thing these words have with Flemish and Dutch is the sound similarity. The Flemish region was somewhat artificially formed during Hitler's invasion of Belgium in the second world war, as a result of the fact that he plagued and brought forward the Dutch minority, which is more prone to cooperation within Belgium, and recovering in the north. Their language is called Dutch. Dutch (Dutch) and the similarity between the Flemish, Turkey is far more advanced than the similarities between Turkish and Azeri Turkish. They actually watch the same televisions and listen to the same radios. Rather, it resembles the similarity of English and US English.

The first form is considered to be the traditional one, it is used above all in buildings of great historical symbolism and in high altitudes and, therefore, its use is more solemn. The second form, on the other hand, is modern in general and common use, probably due to the 2: 3 mimicry of the flags of Spain and the European Union that, together with the flag, are used on the facades of government buildings of the Valencian Community. The only legal reference on size is to affirm that it cannot be greater than the flag of Spain, nor less than the flag of other Entities (applicable to the European Union).

There is no country or state called Kurdistan. Or unfortunately there is not. Had Osman Baydemir been a citizen of the Kurdistan state, the Kurdistan state would have been a problem if he had identified his citizens as Kurds; but Osman Baydemir, the mayor must be a citizen of the Republic of Turkey to be, it already is, Wikipedia is written in the person of citizenship, without specifying any additional information (such as citizens).

Their opposing countries are under occupation. They are based on Anatolian civilization known as meds before Turks. Whereas gypsies were communities that lived in diaspora in many European countries, similar to Jews. d) novel communities indian-dravidian are rarely white, mostly light brown and dark brown, and do not meet the criteria of the race. Also, facial expressions and shapes are similar to those of south indian. However, we are different from the purebred white race. The anthropological features of the Persians are almost the same as in southern Europe. But Turkish and Turkish lovers, who are dissatisfied with the yellow race they live in, abuse the closeness between Iranian and Indian cultures and try to compare us with novels. Their aim is to make primitive colonial fascism permanent. e) The two ethnic groups are Turks and Arabs who can be put in the same category with the novels.

1950," Thank you for your comments on the subject. (1) There is a real possibility that the first sentence you mentioned can be confused with totipotent, so it may be appropriate to make an arrangement. However, with the change you made, the information of differentiation to all cell types was repeated exactly 3 times; Considering that it would be more beneficial to give the most accurate information in the simplest way, rather than creating a stack of information; it would be more beneficial to make the changes we made in accordance with the entire paragraph. (2) I do not think it is necessary to change the definition of pluripotent cells, the earliest stem cells identified. The point of accepting zygote or blastomers as stem cells is questionable, since these cells absorb direct return (type) to any body cell without going through the blastocyst stage, so the earliest stem cells that can be identified are considered pluripotent stem cells. (3) I do not think it is necessary and urgent to change the title. I am of the opinion that if the subject expands further and slides in a certain direction, then its replacement may come to the agenda. For one reason, perhaps in English, pluripotency is used as often as pluripotent, but in Turkish, the word pluripotent is used much more than pluripotent, so I think that pluripotent is a more appropriate word in terms of accessibility. .

On a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which you can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked. ; This sinful pleasure is a fresh triumph for Lynch, and one of the best films of a sorry-ass year. For visionary daring, swooning eroticism and colors that pop like a whore s lip gloss, there s nothing like this baby anywhere. and This voluptuous phantasmagoria [...] is certainly Lynch s strongest movie since Blue Velvet and maybe Eraserhead. The very things that failed him in the bad-boy rockabilly debacle of Lost Highway — the atmosphere of free-floating menace, pointless transmigration of souls, provocatively dropped plot stitches, gimcrack alternate universes — are here brilliantly rehabilitated.

The most well-known form of this method is the zazen application in Zen. Another form of this second method used in the Far East is explained as follows: There is no pre-agreed, concentrated topic, the mind must remain thoughtless and kept empty. As meditation progresses, the time it takes to keep the mind empty also increases. During this void, there is an inspiration to the mind. The influence that comes to mind sometimes comes from beings with high levels of spiritual evolution. The purpose of leaving the mind empty to calm is to allocate space for these influences that can intuitively appear inside. While such intuitions come to man at other times, they come easier, more open, stronger and more original in meditation. However, the method based on keeping the mind empty without sufficient knowledge and experience may invite a great danger called obsession.",0

2123,"In the Taxonomy / nomenclature section there is the following paragraph: Confusion between Hantavirus and Hantaan Virus is frequent.

What does exist is the Hantaan Virus (or HTNV for short), the type species of the Hantavirus genus and the one that gives the group its name. It is common to find this type of error in the Castilian literature, often expressed with a number mismatch, considering Hantavirus as a singular noun, or mentioning a Hanta virus when the generic name Hantavirus corresponds. I think there is a contradiction between what this paragraph says and the rest of the article, or at least it seems very confusing to someone like me who is not a specialist.

This is part of our ongoing efforts to provide new and better tools to our users, such as interwiki notifications. As a result, each user will have the same username on all projects. This will allow for new features to better edit and discuss, as well as more flexible user permissions. In particular, usernames will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia projects. For more information, read the announcement. Unfortunately, another person uses your username, Solano, elsewhere. To make sure that both of you can contribute to our projects in the future, your username will be changed to Solano ~ itwiki. If you like it, you don't need to do anything; but you can request a different username. Your account will function exactly as before and you will be attributed with all the changes you have made, but you will need to use your new username to log in. We apologize for the inconvenience.

But in any case, I can't resist asking you to improve as long as you can or have time in World War I. Surely in the current circumstances you are by far the most suitable to do it. Little by little. Or as you consider. Perhaps involving others as well. Only if possible. But you know that it's been there for a long time. And what is most important is what is most important and the rest should be in the background. Another thing. You can also try to involve others in the writing of the most visited and give the awards you consider. I am sure that from your position in Acad you know who our first swords are at the moment and you could try to pull them to improve the most visited ones.

However, although excessive writing pushes the newcomer to make changes without much clicking on the links he sees as boring or a waste of time, many users contribute their opinions without researching the links in the ""welcome"" or even thinking about what the message page does. Since it contradicts the content of the desired substance, it begins to write directly on the discussion pages of the item (""fishing""). Therefore, I think the “content policies” on the far right of the new version are very useful. Finally, I think the contributions of DsMurat will be useful in the formal design of the new version.

The Jesuitesse lemma (which I know very well) is very clear on the subject. The choice to mention them as part of a phantom Jesuit family is arbitrary and unprecedented. The voice on the Fracescana family is a separate matter: the subject of the voice is not clear and over time it has become a sewer where to pour news collected by the network on small groups born in recent years. I realize that those who ignore notions such as aggregation, secular and regular third order, spiritual family and approach this topic with the lightness of the lover have difficulty in realizing the absurdity of such a table, but similar information is devoid of sources and degrades sensibly the voice.

Flamenco as singing and dancing begins to take shape in taverns and brothels, adopting different popular artistic traditions: Andalusian, Arab, etc. (Let's not forget that the Andalusia of the time had very important ports such as Cádiz or Seville) and transforming, merging or inventing them to the delight of sailors and outsiders.

There are many systems for making money from the internet. I believe it will be more effective than stuffed information. First, let's talk about the vigilance in systems that make money by filling out a questionnaire. 1) The questionnaires sent to you are non-refundable. That is, the survey company has no connection with the related companies, so it does not pay you money. 2) The payment of the money to be paid to you in return for the filled questionnaires, with a lottery method. 3) Survey companies don't take anything out of the companies and pay you anything. In addition to such fraud, there are also survey companies that do their job well. But it is a big problem to find their addresses. It is an intense effort that requires you to deal with for months. I recommend the questionnaire to the friends who want to make money by filling the questionnaire. It is a nice book with safe sites. [ You can review the product from the link below.]",0

3056,"The indictment of the prosecutor has been put almost entirely on the page of Fethullah Gulenin, unlike any other. However, he was acquitted from this indictment. In other words, there is no legal or real share left, except that this indictment is the personal opinion of the prosecutor. Therefore, I think that the part related to the case of Fethullah Gulen has been abbreviated and only needs to be changed as it is acquitted and that it can be changed as follows: It can be changed by the State Security Court of Ankara on 22 August 2000, instead of changing the structure of the Secular State about Fethullah Gülen on 22 August 2000. The trial, which started with a request for up to 10 years in prison for establishing an illegal organization and carrying out activities for this purpose, resulted in acquittal. First, the 11th High Criminal Court of Ankara and then the 9th Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court was unanimously brought to the agenda of the General Assembly of the Criminal Court of the Supreme Court yesterday. Discussing the objection of the Chief Public Prosecutor, the highest judicial authority ruled that Gülen had no action against the state. Having found the acquittal and approval decisions in accordance with the law, the General Assembly stated that there was no evidence to prove the accusations.

In addition, it is useful to create a link for current dates as the information in it may need to be updated. For example, should there be a year connection in the settlements? While the population in 1997 was mentioned, the connection to 1997 seems to be meaningless. Or match dates in season items, for example. Birth dates written on March 20, 1955?

I would like to remind you that although the official name of the monument is not specifically stated that it is the Monument of Honor, it is not an expression that it is officially a Statue of Atatürk. Let me also draw your attention to a nuance difference. Especially ... even though there is no informative sentence such as sculpture ... whose official name is the Monument of Honor, the term Honor Monument is used in the title and in the sentence, as it should be in private names, the text of Onur's water and the Monument is written in large text. However, Atatürk Hykeli is used in both sources. Despite saying, you have missed the nuance difference again. There is a dedication, not the name of the monument. Because Atatürk writes a statue, the letter h is lowercase. If it is necessary to enter a name dilemma, it will be entered into the Gazi Statue / Honor Monument dilemma where, like the special name, they wrote the Gazi Statue in capital letters g and h.

3149," This comes from the difference between Latin and Greek. In Latin, the letters C are read if K precedes the vowel or consonant, if S precedes the consonant or Y, S is read. That's why Cefal is read as Sefal. In Greek, all of these are read with K, meaning that the word Kefali Kefali was passed to Latin and it was called Sefal. In scientific language, we naturally read this as Hydrocephalus, not Idrokefal. In Cyclone and Cyclon, one such Lantine se Cyclone is read in Greek Cyclone. That's why I prefer the first form of a language, what language I prefer, like we read centimeter If we don't say centimeter, Gigabyte should never be read Cigabyte, the original word of this word is Gigas giant, there is no point in making the first letter G here like C British. They read Isis i Aysis, Osiris i Osayris, one of the Egyptian gods. I propose to you the Dictionary of Etymology of Sevan Nişanyan, it is a dictionary that tells the origin of many foreign words in Turkish.

3242,"Hello there . This is a NE rather than a category discussion. Also, considering the template is working, it's an action against excessive categorization. The provincial directors have a Community experience that they are not encyclopedic as a separate person, and since they are provincial directors in the biographies in these categories, they do not have the status of being counted as the provincial directors for a period of time, these are the categories that were opened by curious users such as Yzkoc / Sarv. In many, there are only a few people, and it is clear that these categories are opened only for those people. I had a little explanation about that here. Ultimately, I do not mind doing excessive categorization and fast deletion of categories that are not encyclopedic. But if you say we must go to the Community, we will make explanations about the cleaning of these categories, to the provincial directors of the Community, etc. It is also a fact that biographies can go to overcategorization if there is a tendency to open as many sub-categories, but there is no problem for me, there will be a corrector after a while, there is no escape as the Turkish wiki develops even though it is heavy. We are unique to ourselves as wiki logic, but we still have to watch other wikis in the sorting technique. Although not as much as the German categorization model, we should also have measures against overcategorization. Vikicizer (message) 17.00, 24 July 2018 (UTC)",0

Just as TDVİA Selahaddin-i Eyyûbî says, if you say that usage is much more common, I say that it should be Selahaddin for a similar reason because the word -din is not used in Turkish.

In other words, it would be correct to say a province for Butler County. But there were two exceptions to this, Alaska and Louisiana, which were given another name. As for the term borough - Chicora, Pennsylvania was a borough - which varies even between states. They didn't even make a full definition. All boroughs like Chicora have a municipal-like structure, but their population is usually between 1000 and 3000. When I translated it into Turkish, I decided that the most appropriate definition would be the town you used.

The point I wish to comment on is the following: The Mexican Army is the result of the evolution of the revolutionary forces that emerged from the Constitutionalist Army, when it was subjected to the reorganization and modernization imposed by General Joaquín Amaro; such program included the revalidation of the rank for the high officers, imposition of discipline mainly between generals and chiefs, professionalizing the cadres of chiefs and classes, fighting corruption and improving in all its senses the services of the army. In addition, he channeled the political aspirations of the revolutionary ex-combatants. In the paragraph quoted above, it can be understood that Gral. Joaquín Amaro channeled the political aspirations of the revolutionary ex-combatants, these political aspirations were channeled with the founding of the National Revolutionary Party in which Gral Amaro never participated ... therefore I have allowed myself to eliminate that part of the original paragraph in the mentioning article ....

Joking aside, fair use is seriously misused and is used only when there is no free licensed image that can describe the same subject while it has the ability to fully describe a subject. For example, it is not possible to have a free licensed picture that can describe a book, because the most important thing to describe is its cover, but the book covers are almost always copyrighted works. However, when describing the subject of a book, there may be many pictures related to the subject and to describe the subject (for example, pictures of some related people, if it is a concept, diagrams that can be used to depict the concept, etc.), and undoubtedly, the only picture that can often be depicted is not a copybook cover image. For this reason, it can also be deleted. Also, whether it is a book cover or any other picture, it will make it easier for us to understand why it is appropriate or inappropriate when you add pictures under fair use.

This is part of our ongoing efforts to provide new and better tools to our users, such as interwiki notifications. As a result, each user will have the same username on all projects. This will allow for new features to better edit and discuss, as well as more flexible user permissions. In particular, usernames will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia projects. For more information, read the announcement. Unfortunately, another person uses your username, Antiquarian, elsewhere. To make sure that both of you can contribute to our projects in the future, your username will be changed to Antiquarian ~ itwiki.

After all, it is known that this nickname is quite settled, and Şükür has clearly stated that he is not bothered by it. Although he was nicknamed with the intention of making fun of me, I think his previous state was good because of his fame (and therefore his encyclopedicity). The given link was also very reinforcing. How about you? (Note: I do not have a positive or negative opinion about him or his team, for those who read it) Vito Genovese Vito is actually a degree right in the part you say, but as far as I understand in the interview, I do not say I love this nickname. He used the sentence they cannot influence me, he says that I understand from here that he doesn't like it but he will not be affected badly. This is at least my opinion, but degrading etc. I think the nickname shouldn't be sentences.

The point where I disagree with content is that feudalism is not a form of organization, but a form of production. However, in the first three quarters of the last century, Western historians adopted an analysis of the organization form, even though the analysis that feudalism was a form of production evoked the thesis of Marxist historians. After the end of the Cold War, Western historians began to turn more towards this analysis. But even if you analyzed feudalism as a form of organization, you did not disturb the integrity of the matter, you clearly explained the infrastructure of the order.

5324,"Dear heart friends, When I see the demand burden accumulated on this page, I would like to give a small reminder as the person who started the process, humble. This process is not a process for community decision making, such as VP: SAS and VP: KT. Here is just a simple concept: The servants have an authority that is not available to other users (migrating where pages with multiple versions in the past are targeted, and merging page history) and this is a central platform for requests for the use of this authority. To make this change, either the rules or precedent decisions must definitely support this move, or the transaction must be a non-dispute transaction. In other words, having a discussion under the transport demands is a sufficient reason to refuse this demand directly. Is the discussion a general practice? Community decision is required. The request must be rejected. Did two users disagree about this migration? The issue must be resolved and the request rejected on the discussion page of the page. What needs to be done is to leave time for objection to other users for requests (if potential is apparent) and to apply technical authority if there is no dispute. In this context, I request that these issues be observed for the current demands. Vito Genovese",0

Such a science fiction story about developing inner mental capacity was so successful and Hubbard received so many letters from fans asking if his story was true that he decided there were better ways to make money than writing novels and how others (JJ Benitez) did pass their fictional stories for reality.

A summary of the discussions on the topic can be found here. In fact, you are right; the problem is that there is no broad consensus neither for the cross (or as you want to call it) nor for the abbreviation m. , with the difference that this is supported by coherence with conventions and use (starting from n.). The full form would be good for everyone, and I don't see why it should be excluded from the general principle of the style manual, the sense of which is that abbreviations can be confusing, or in any case the full form is a simplification, and given that we do not have space problems is preferable (except, in fact, where there is no space). It is true, however, that the effect may not be the best, even if, for example, it doesn't seem bad to me here. A survey is excessive, for heaven's sake, but I can try to draw attention again.

The literal translation was god from the machine and was used in the meaning of lowering the character that portrays a god in ancient Greek theater with the help of a crane (machina). It is a method frequently used by the authors in theater works written in the Ancient Greek period. The course of the story becomes so complex, inexhaustible that there is no longer any interesting solution that the author can produce, and as a frequently used method, mythological gods emerge and intervene in an instant; they kill those who have to die, and those who need to be rescued.",0

Additionally, the United Nations and European Union bodies of translators use Bangladesh to refer to the country in Spanish documents. And as a dessert cherry, there is a recommendation from the United Nations Conferences on the Standardization of Geographical Names and the Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNEGN), regarding the new names Geographies that have been created and those that are created in the future are not exonymous, but the official place name is adopted, especially as a result of the territorial changes resulting from World War II and the rejection of the colonialist tradition in the countries that acquired for the first time its independence.

5823,"We always know that Wikipedia is not an authority where Turkish words are registered. In this respect, we have to act especially on TDK and other Turkish dictionaries with it. According to the dictionaries, Dutch is a valid word in force. It is also a valid word in Dutch according to the TDK dictionary. However, this is not synonymous with Dutch. In the sense of the language spoken in the Netherlands. That is, spoken outside the Belgium in the northern region of the Netherlands. This is how the explanations in Wikipedia are. If we start to use Dutch in the meaning of Turkish here in the dictionaries of Turkish dictionaries, we will have to use a completely different word for northern accents, which is not present in Turkish. Also, what shall we say to the southern accents? In the current article we call them (correctly) Dutch. It would not be correct to call them Dutch, since this word includes the whole Dutch land historically, namely the common language spoken in the north of France from Dunquerque to the north of the Netherlands. So we have to call the southern accents in Dutch and completely put the Dutch into history. So why should we do this? Why should we ignore a word that is real, adds wealth to Turkish, exists in dictionaries and encyclopaedias? I present it to your appreciation. Regards, Foobar",0

5906,"Greetings Saygıner. Something came to my mind yesterday, and now it came to my mind when you carried a stadium item. Estádio da Luz is now the Portuguese name of the stadium. If we write almost all the stadium names in Turkish, this should also be translated into Turkish. Should it be the Luz Stadium or the Light Stadium? What is the limit for translating proper names here? Rapsar Sir? Hello, Rapsar. As I have encountered in en.wiki, there are namings that are generally settled in their original form from French and Spanish. For example, in the news of BBC Fener match, Estádio also uses it as Luz; It does not translate as Luz Stadium. With us, ntvspor match report Stad: When we say Luz, it is possible to come across a comedy expression such as Luz Stadium at tr.eurosport. Personally, I did not see a stadium in English with a stadium in Turkish, and so I carry what I see in English directly. If Spanish and French (Estádio da Luz, Estádio Nacional etc.) have been translated in Turkish sources (unfortunately our reporters have been very criminal about this), I say that the island can be moved. I cannot see a very clear boundary in this regard.",0

Hello, Mr. Uguruyanik, First of all thanks for your contributions, Our criterion for uploading photos should not be copyrighted photographs. So many photographs you find on the internet are copyrighted by the creator. Even if you took a photo, you should not have shared it on the internet before or you should do the procedure we call OTRS, which I do not know very well! You can learn about copyright information by visiting this page. Or you can directly contribute the photo to the wiki.

He was tried in the Bitlis Divan War and was executed on the morning of April 14, 1925, one day before the Youth Event was suppressed. [2] This paragraph touches on: His brother, who was suspected of provoking the revolt and leading the organization azadi, was caught before the Sheikh Sait (called youth incident) rebellion. Sheikh Sait never participated in the rebellion, but was executed. The reader comes to mind: What was the crime? Is it suspected that it only provoked the Rebellion and was the leader of the Azadi organization? Was he executed on a suspicion? There is incomplete information here, and deliberate bias.

What Nozick tends to reject is complete relativism, the impossibility of an ultimate truth. I think Philip K. Dick would agree with him, (reality is what he refuses to disappear even when you stop believing it), Albert Einstein (God does not play dice ...) and also some Buddhist philosopher (the koan of the pupil who declared the unknowable reality, to which the teacher bludgeoned).

6267,"Hello Handsome128, Let me count the problems one by one: First of all, the resolution is very, very high. Such a high resolution makes usage unfair and harms the rights of the copyright owner. In addition, fair use files should have a very important contribution to the substance. The semi-final draw is not very important, but photographs showing an event moment with its own item are very important. In this respect, inappropriate picture. It is not possible for us to use it for these two reasons; What would we need procedurally if I could use it? The source of the image was entered as eurovision.tv, which is insufficient. There should be a URL, and when we click on that URL, we should preferably access a page containing the information of the picture, if not, we should directly access the picture.

Everyone here uses Nederlands (Dutch) instead of Vlaams (Flemish) in what language you speak. As the official language written in Nederlands, which is not already Vlaams in the state's constitution. In fact, I am talking about the language as a person who lives in Belgium and speaks Dutch well, and I hear that Vlaams is called once in 100 times, in the remaining 99 times everyone says Dutch. When asked about the language between two Dutch-speaking people, Vlaams directly calls their own dialects instead of Nederlands, for example West Vlaams, Limburgs, Antwaarps etc. Yours sincerely BillyG",0

YOU HAVE! YOU HAVE! (Peer Southern Italy / CNI) WELCOME MONSTERS (2002, Target / Sony) etc. We are therefore well above the fateful 2 albums ... 2. Concerts, tours, festivals of national importance: City of Recanati Award, concert Faber fragile friend in 2000 with many of the major Italian artists, various solo tours, opening tour Fabrizio De André summer 1998, etc. This point too, therefore, is not contestable. 3. The aforementioned concert Faber fragile friend is a sufficient example: the concert also produced a double CD (in 2003); another example is Musicultura (also broadcast on radio rai).

So far the norm. However, in general, the name is chosen to translate works that are more classical or that already have a wide bibliography (for example, ""The Birth of Venus""), and more contemporary or lesser-known works are usually left in their original language (the Combines of Rauschenberg). The same happens with the sites, Casa Blanca is translated, but La Défense is not. If what you are looking for is to homogenize the article, I would recommend you continue translating the names of the works, if any translation squeaks a bit (such as Barrios Españoles), you could leave the original name. Nor should we fall into the absurdity of fully translating everything, but the neighborhood of Queens in NY would be the neighborhood of Queens!

I wonder why they have not been previously consulted and linked. I advise you to consult the pages of the Gazzetta dello Sport where possible because all the rounds of the Italian Cup until 1973 were published and signed by the then press officer of the F.F.I.U.A.G.C. Alberto Valentini. All qualifying rounds can probably be reconstructed by means of the cited newspapers.

7596,"Greetings. Template: Thank you for preparing the Holy Roman Emperors. It was a very necessary template. I made some changes to that template. I want to get your opinion by telling you the reasons for the changes I made. I transformed the emperors' names into German ones. If we look at the items in other languages ​​related to these emperors, each language is used in that language. For example, like Henry, Heinrich, Enrique, Enrico. These languages ​​are the languages ​​of Christian countries. Therefore, these names have their own unique versions in every country. However, in Turkish, these names do not exist in Turkish. Therefore, it was decided to use the names in the native language of their country for the kings in Wikipedia. For example, since the language of the Papacy is Latin, the names of Popes are written in Latin (See: Discussion: XVI. Benedictus). I think this is the most reasonable use style. What do you think about this? When the name of the country was written next to the names of the kings, the tradition of using parentheses instead of commas was put into Turkish Wikipedia. For example, the Ottoman Sultan İbrahim (Sultan), II. Such as Constantine (Greece), Anne (Great Britain), I. François (France). In this case, the item name of Maximilian I (Holy Roman Emperor) can also be used for the Holy Roman Emperors. Say what? Greetings. Good luck with. -Vikiyaz is",0

With this system, the lack of understanding imposed by the different languages ​​is avoided. Thus, for example, the animal that in Spanish we call rabbit, in Euskera untxi, in English rabbit, in French lapin and in German wildkanichen, scientifically it is called Oryctolagus cuniculus, name universally accepted and understood.

I would be of the idea that the voice must be moved to Quinto al Mare, adjusting all the entries pointing to Quinto al mare and then eliminating the redirect from Quinto al mare because it is not an alternative but simply incorrect denomination (as could be Frabosa sottana, Novi Ligurian or Sestri ponente).

For example, if we try to describe them by looking at the Altais, we will describe not the Tengricism, but the form of Zoroastrianism and Taoism mixed with Shamanism! Tengricism in the Mongols is not much different from the old Turkish Tengricism. They know Ötüken as the mother earth, and sometimes they call it Itgen or Etügen. They name some lakes and mountains as Öutgen. Likewise, Tengri's name is given to some mountains and lakes.

In a balanced system, theoretical deviance, tolerated by the law, is not the subject of attention by the police. When deviance, albeit theoretical, takes on connotations of social danger, so much so that the Law cannot or does not want to do something, it is the Police who undertakes to ensure that deviance becomes practical and therefore the competence of the Law.
